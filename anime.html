        <h2>What is Anime?</h2>
        <p>Anime is a style of animation originating from Japan that has captivated audiences around the globe. It's
            characterized by its colorful art, vibrant characters, and imaginative plots. Unlike Western cartoons, anime
            often explores deep and mature themes, making it appealing to both children and adults. The unique artistic
            styles and storytelling techniques distinguish anime from other forms of animation, and it often includes
            exaggerated facial expressions and dramatic visual cues.</p>

        <h2>History of Anime</h2>
        <p>The history of anime is rich and varied. It began in the early 20th century, with the first anime films being
            produced in Japan. However, it was not until the post-World War II era that anime truly began to flourish.
            In the 1960s, Osamu Tezuka, often referred to as the 'God of Manga,' created "Astro Boy," which became an
            international success and paved the way for future anime series. The 1980s saw the rise of iconic series
            such as "Dragon Ball" and "Mobile Suit Gundam," which helped establish anime as a major cultural export. The
            1990s and 2000s continued this trend with titles like "Naruto," "One Piece," and "Fullmetal Alchemist," all
            of which garnered global fandom.</p>
